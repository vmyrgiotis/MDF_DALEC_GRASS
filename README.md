# MDF DALEC GRASS package 

##Â Description 

This is a python package that implement an climate-driven, grassland-specific ecosystem biogeochemistry model by assimilating earth observation (EO) data on vegetation volume (@10-20m resolution).

## Allows you to perform the following actions : 

1. Collect earth observation (EO) data from the ESA Sentinel 1 and 2 systems
2. Process the EO data into time series of grass biomass
3. Implement a probabilistic model-data fusion (MDF) algorithm to estimate C dynamics in a grassland field

## It requires working accounts with : 

1. [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu)
2. [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets)
3. [Amazon Web Services](https://digital-geography.com/accessing-landsat-and-sentinel-2-on-amazon-web-services/#.V3Lr1I68EfI) (if not accessing UK LAI data on datastore)

The [Sentinel Application Platform](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/) should be installed on your system 

## Downloading

To download this package run "git clone https://github.com/vmyrgiotis/MDF_DALEC_GRASS.git"
